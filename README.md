# Console draw

1. The code in this repo outputs the following square

		###########
		##       ##
		# #     # #
		#  #   #  #
		#   # #   #
		#    #    #
		#   # #   #
		#  #   #  #
		# #     # #
		##       ##
		###########

2. Expand the solution to include the following user stories:
    1. As a USER I want to be able to change the size of the square SO it fits my sqaure needs
    2. AS a USER I want an X where lines intersect SO I can easily identify intersections
    3. AS a USER I want a neat intersetion that doesn't cross "between characters" SO it is presentable to my customers.
3. Write tests that ensures the user stories above are implemented correctly.
4. Make a PR with your solution
